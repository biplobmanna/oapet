## Open Any ProjEcT (OAPET)
Open my web projects from anywhere, and in my favourite editor. 
Born from the need to:
* practice some python
* automate the boring parts
<br>This is the first in a series of automation to ease the boring work!

### Configuration
Make changes to .config as per your need. <br>
Right now, there is only support for one editor, and one project path. 

### Dependencies
* python3
* fuzzysearch -- install using `pip3 install fuzzysearch`


### Usage
* Call the `main.py` from anywhere using **python3**<br>
	`python3 /path/to/app/folder/main.py <search_term_here>`
* Better usage: Create an alias, eg:<br> 
	`alias op='/bin/python3 /path/to/app/folder/main.py'`
	<br>use: `op <search_term_here>`

### Future Scope
* Support for multiple editors
* Better Fuzzy Search implementation
* Interactive Search
* Basically, make it more like using FZF, but for projects

### When will I get around to it?
Well, gee, who knows! Let's see. Maybe soon, maybe never, or maybe someday when fancy strikes me!

### License
None whatsoever. Do your worst, but at your own risk. I am not liable for anything you do! Not one teensy bit.
